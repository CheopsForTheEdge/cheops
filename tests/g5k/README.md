# Testing on g5k

The current directory contains a few integration tests. Feel free to take inspiration from them

To instantiate machines, run ./install.py.
To clean the content and (re-)start cheops, run ./rerun.sh.
To easily see the logs, run ./multitail.sh

After that any test can be run, through make, or individually
